 * From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire :
 *
 * 1-Wire is a device communications bus system designed by Dallas
 * Semiconductor Corp. that provides low-speed data, signaling, and power over
 * a single conductor.  1-Wire is similar in concept to I2C, but with lower
 * data rates and longer range. It is typically used to communicate with small
 * inexpensive devices such as digital thermometers and weather instruments. A
 * network of 1-Wire devices with an associated master device is called a
 * MicroLAN.  One distinctive feature of the bus is the possibility of using
 * only two wires: data and ground.  To accomplish this, 1-Wire devices include
 * an 800 pF capacitor to store charge, and to power the device during periods
 * when the data line is active.

 *
 * From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%B2C :
 *
 * I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced I-squared-C, is a multi-master,
 * multi-slave, single-ended, serial computer bus invented by Philips
 * Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is typically used for attaching
 * lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in
 * short-distance, intra-board communication. Alternatively I2C is spelled I2C
 * (pronounced I-two-C) or IIC (pronounced I-I-C).  Since October 10, 2006, no
 * licensing fees are required to implement the I2C protocol. However, fees are
 * still required to obtain I2C slave addresses allocated by NXP.  Several
 * competitors, such as Siemens AG (later Infineon Technologies AG, now Intel
 * mobile communications), NEC, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics (formerly
 * SGS-Thomson), Motorola (later Freescale, now merged with NXP), Nordic
 * Semiconductor and Intersil, have introduced compatible I2C products to the
 * market since the mid-1990s.  SMBus, defined by Intel in 1995, is a subset of
 * I2C that defines the protocol use more strictly. One purpose of SMBus is to
 * promote robustness and interoperability. Accordingly, modern I2C systems
 * incorporate some policies and rules from SMBus, sometimes supporting both
 * I2C and SMBus, requiring only minimal reconfiguration either by commanding
 * or output pin use.

 *
 * From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus :
 *
 * The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus is a synchronous serial
 * communication interface specification used for short distance communication,
 * primarily in embedded systems.  The interface was developed by Motorola and
 * has become a de facto standard.  Typical applications include Secure Digital
 * cards and liquid crystal displays.  SPI devices communicate in full duplex
 * mode using a master-slave architecture with a single master.  The master
 * device originates the frame for reading and writing.  Multiple slave devices
 * are supported through selection with individual slave select (SS) lines.
 * Sometimes SPI is called a four-wire serial bus, contrasting with three-,
 * two-, and one-wire serial buses.  The SPI may be accurately described as a
 * synchronous serial interface, but it is different to the Synchronous Serial
 * Interface (SSI) protocol, which is also a four-wire synchronous serial
 * communication protocol, but employs differential signaling and provides
 * only a single simplex communication channel.

/**
 * #define BP_ENABLE_UART_SUPPORT
 *
 * Enable UART I/O support in the built firmware.
 *
 * @note BPv3 default firmware status: INCLUDED
 * @note BPv4 default firmware status: INCLUDED
 *
 * From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UART :
 *
 * A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter, abbreviated UART, is a
 * computer hardware device that translates data between characters (usually
 * bytes) in a computer and an asynchronous serial communication format that
 * encapsulates those characters between start bits and stop bits.  UARTs are
 * commonly used in conjunction with communication standards such as TIA
 * (formerly EIA) RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485.  The universal designation
 * indicates that the data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
 * The electric signaling levels and methods (such as differential signaling
 * etc.) are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART.  A UART is
 * usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for
 * serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port.
 * UARTs are now commonly included in microcontrollers.  A dual UART, or DUART,
 * combines two UARTs into a single chip.  An octal UART or OCTART combines
 * eight UARTs into one package, such as the Exar XR16L788 or the NXP SCC2698.
 * A related device, the Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous
 * Receiver/Transmitter (USART) also supports synchronous operation.

/**

 *
 * Enables support for driving a switched mode power supply via binary I/O

 *
 * @note BPv3 default firmware status: DISABLED
 * @note BPv4 default firmware status: OPTIONAL
 *
 * The schematic for such an interface board can be found at
 * http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_SMPS - although it is not
 * clear whether this design is compatible with the current code.  In the
 * DangerousPrototypes' repository, support for the SMPS board was limited to
 * Bus Pirate v4 boards, whilst the information on that page is dated from 2010.
 *
 * From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply :
 *
 * A switched-mode power supply (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power
 * supply, switched power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power
 * supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power
 * efficiently. Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or
 * AC source (often mains power), to DC loads, such as a personal computer,
 * while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power
 * supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches
 * between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little
 * time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy.
 * Ideally, a switched-mode power supply dissipates no power. Voltage regulation
 * is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear
 * power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in
 * the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important
 * advantage of a switched-mode power supply. Switched-mode power supplies may
 * also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the
 * smaller transformer size and weight.
 *
 * @todo Clarify whether this code can still be used.
